Hello! I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics](http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/BIG/) program at Harvard Medical School. I am co-advised by [Sasha Gusev](http://gusevlab.org/) (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) and [Brian Cleary](https://clearylab.org/) (Broad Institute). I received my B.S. in Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology from UCLA in 2018. In my free time, I like to play piano and guitar, and sing poorly.
