I"‰<p>â€œHeritabilityâ€ is a quantity that is central to human genetics, and there is a huge amount of literature aiming to estimate various forms of it. Despite its ubiquity, there also seems to be a dearth of resources that explain what it actually is, in a way that is understandable to non-experts. Iâ€™m hoping that this blog post can address this.</p>

<p>I will start off by just giving the textbook definition of heritability. It is the â€œproportion of varianceâ€ in a population that can â€œbe explainedâ€ by genetics. What do these words actually mean?</p>
