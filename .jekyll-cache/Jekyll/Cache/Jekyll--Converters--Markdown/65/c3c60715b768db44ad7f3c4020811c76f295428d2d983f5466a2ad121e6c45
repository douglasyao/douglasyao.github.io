<p>Hello! I am a 3rd year PhD student in the <a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/BIG/">Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics</a> program at Harvard Medical School. I am co-advised by <a href="http://gusevlab.org/">Sasha Gusev</a> (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) and <a href="https://clearylab.org/">Brian Cleary</a> (Broad Institute). I received my B.S. in Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology from UCLA. In my free time, I like to play piano and guitar, and sing poorly.</p>
