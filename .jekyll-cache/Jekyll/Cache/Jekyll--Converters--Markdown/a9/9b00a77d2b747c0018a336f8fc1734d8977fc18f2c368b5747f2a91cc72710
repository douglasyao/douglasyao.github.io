I"Ê<p>My research interests have previously been in the field of statistical genetics, with a focus on the integration of QTL data with GWAS to inform molecular disease mechanisms. More recently, I have been working on designing and analyzing high-throughput CRISPR screens known as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416316105?via%3Dihub">Perturb-seq</a> in order to learn causal gene on gene effects at genome scale. My goals are to integrate this data with GWAS to dissect regulatory gene networks of complex diseases, and to design combinatorial perturbation screens to explore the vast landscape of combinatorial genetic interactions.</p>
