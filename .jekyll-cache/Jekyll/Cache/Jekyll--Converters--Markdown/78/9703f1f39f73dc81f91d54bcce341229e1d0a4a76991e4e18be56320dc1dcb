I"-<p>“Heritability” is a quantity that is central to human genetics, and there is a huge amount of literature aiming to estimate various forms of it. Despite its ubiquity, there also seems to be a dearth of resources that explain what it actually is, in a way that is understandable to non-experts. I’m hoping that this blog post can address this. I’ll assume that the reader has at least a basic understanding of genetics (for example, you should know what a SNP, or genetic variant, is).</p>

<p>Heritability is the “proportion of variance” in a population of people that can “be explained” by genetic variants. What do these words actually mean?</p>

<p>The notion of “proportion of variance explained” is an important concept in statistics. We must first start with some variable, which we’ll call \(y\). In our case, this variable will represent some real-life quantity such as an individual’s height. Next, we must define some model that attempts to “explain” \(y\) in some way using other variables, which we’ll call \(x_1, x_2,  \cdots, x_k \). In our case, \(x_k\) represents the minor allele count of a given SNP \(k\). Thus, we can write our model for \(y\) as something like this:</p>

<p>\[ y = f(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k) + \epsilon \]</p>

<p>What should this function \(f\) look like? In the simplest case, it could be a simple additive function of</p>

<p>Why do we care about variance in the first place? Well, we can think of the variance of \(y\) as a</p>

<p>Thus, we can write</p>
