<p>I am broadly interested in anything to do with statistics/machine learning, genetics/genomics, and biotechnology. As an undergraduate, I conducted research in computational cancer genomics. I conceived and led a project aiming to identify associations between gene expression levels and a cancer phenotype known as ‚Äúgenomic instability‚Äù (which is a metric of how quickly tumors mutate) in large databases of tumor sequencing data. The project culminated in a manuscript I wrote that was published in Scientific Reports.</p>

<p>As a graduate student, my research has been in statistical genetics, a field dating back to Ronald Fisher in the 1920s which aims to study the statistical relationship between genetics and phenotype in human or animal populations. In this venue, I worked on a project that involved defining a quantity known as ‚Äúheritability mediated by gene expression levels,‚Äù which quantifies how much total genetic effect on a phenotype ‚Äúflows through‚Äù separately measured gene expression levels. I derived a novel method of moments estimator of this quantity, established its properties (including bias, consistency, and calibration under the null) via derivations and simulations, and applied it to real human disease genetics data. The project culminated in a manuscript I wrote that was published in Nature Genetics.</p>

<p>I am currently working on general experimental and computational strategies to learn combinatorial effects of multiple treatments on any biological model system <em>at scale</em>. Normally, if one wants to study all pairs of <em>n</em> distinct treatments on some model system, one needs to conduct at least <em>n</em> choose 2 experiments (which exhaustively enumerates all pairs of the <em>n</em> treatments). I am investigating an alternative framework inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing">compressed sensing</a> in signal processing, which involves conducting a relatively small number of <em>random composite experiments</em> (i.e. experiments that involve applying random combinations of many treatments), then recovering all information from this set of experiments. This approach can in theory learn the effects of all individual pairs of treatments with comparable accuracy to the exhaustive enumeration approach, while requiring 1-3 orders of magnitude less experiments. I am currently testing this approach in the context of CRISPR gene knockouts to study genetic interaction effects, and hope that it can eventually be used to efficiently screen drug combinations at much larger scales than currently done.</p>
