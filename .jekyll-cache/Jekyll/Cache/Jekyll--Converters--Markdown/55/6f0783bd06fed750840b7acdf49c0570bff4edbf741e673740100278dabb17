I"=<p>“Heritability” is a quantity that is central to human genetics, and there is a huge amount of literature aiming to estimate various forms of it. Despite its ubiquity, there also seems to be a dearth of resources that explain what it actually is, in a way that is understandable to non-experts. I’m hoping that this blog post can address this. I’ll assume that the reader has at least a basic understanding of statistics and genetics (for example, you should know what a SNP is).</p>

<p>Heritability is the “proportion of variance” in a population of people that can “be explained” by genetic variants. What do these words actually mean?</p>
