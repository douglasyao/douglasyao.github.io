I"“<p>â€œHeritabilityâ€ is a quantity that is central to human genetics, and there is a huge amount of literature aiming to estimate various forms of it. Despite its ubiquity, there also seems to be a dearth of resources that explain what it actually is, in a way that is understandable to non-experts. Iâ€™m hoping that this blog post can address this. Iâ€™ll assume that the reader has at least a basic understanding of statistics and genetics (for example, you should know what a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is).</p>

<p>I will start off by just giving the textbook definition of heritability. It is the â€œproportion of varianceâ€ in a population that can â€œbe explainedâ€ by genetic variants. What do these words actually mean?</p>
