I"√9<p>This blog post is meant to accompany my paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0625-2">‚ÄúQuantifying genetic effects on disease mediated by assayed gene expression levels‚Äù</a> (Yao et al. 2020 Nature Genetics), in which we introduced a method called ‚Äúmediated expression score regression‚Äù (MESC) to estimate a quantity ‚Äúheritability mediated by gene expression levels.‚Äù I had originally meant to write it when the paper came out, but better late then never I guess. The paper is unfortunately pretty dense and probably not very accessible to readers not in the field of statistical genetics, so I‚Äôm hoping to provide a non-technical overview of the paper, in which I describe the background, motivation, method, and assumptions. I‚Äôm assuming that you already have a working knowledge of what GWAS and heritability are. If you‚Äôre fuzzy about heritability, you can read my other blog post about it. I also included a glossary that defines all the lingo used in this post (terms such as ‚Äúheritability enrichment‚Äù and ‚ÄúMendelian randomization‚Äù). Note that I‚Äôll use the terms ‚Äútrait‚Äù and ‚Äúdisease‚Äù interchangeably, as well as ‚ÄúSNP‚Äù and ‚Äúvariant.‚Äù</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>A while ago, researchers realized that most of the GWAS hits they found fell into <em>non-coding</em> parts of the genome.</p>

<p>[insert figure]</p>

<p>If you think about how a non-coding SNP might exert its effect on a trait, the first thing that comes to mind is via <em>gene regulation</em> (in other words, altering gene expression levels). This was the motivation behind a series of massive efforts to measure <em>expression quantitative trait loci</em> (eQTLs). The most salient of these efforts has been the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium, which measured expression levels in ~50 tissues for around ~500 individuals. From these studies, many thousands of significant eQTLs covering almost all genes across many tissues have been detected.</p>

<p>Now, what do we do with these eQTLs after measuring them? In particular, how do we integrate them with GWAS hits to tell us something about how the GWAS hits are acting on the phenotype? Many approaches have been developed to do this on an individual gene level, which include ‚Äúcolocalization tests‚Äù and ‚Äútranscriptome-wide association studies‚Äù (TWAS). Long story short, these methods basically look for genes with some sort of ‚Äúoverlap‚Äù between their eQTLs and GWAS hits. If a SNP is both a GWAS hit and an eQTL for a given gene, then we would be inclined to think that this gene is somehow important in the SNP‚Äôs mechanism of action on the trait. In particular, we would like to think that the SNP‚Äôs effect on the trait is <em>mediated</em> through that gene‚Äôs expression.</p>

<p>[insert figure]</p>

<p>Although this mediation scenario is what we want to see, there are in fact other less desirable scenarios that are indistinguishable from mediation to colocalization/TWAS. I will discuss some of these scenarios in a bit.</p>

<p>The individual-gene methods are interesting and useful ways to prioritize disease-relevant genes. However, perhaps we‚Äôd like to take a step back and understand the <em>overall</em> importance of gene expression in ‚Äúexplaining‚Äù a phenotype. Understanding this importance can guide our individual gene analyses and give us an overall idea of how disease-relevant our gene expression measurements are.</p>

<p>With regard to this aim, there had already been some work done before our paper came out. Hormozdiari et al. looked at the overall <em>heritability enrichment</em> of SNPs that we deem to be eQTLs, finding that fine-mapped eQTLs as a whole are enriched for disease heritability. In addition, Chun et al. looked to see what proportion of significant GWAS hits for autoimmune disease ‚Äúcolocalize‚Äù with immune cell eQTLs, finding that only 25% of GWAS hits do so. These results give us an idea of how relevant eQTLs as a whole are to disease. We can see the eQTLs are more disease-relevant than random SNPs (as evidenced by their heritability enrichment), but there are signs that some GWAS hits do not overlap with eQTLs, suggesting that perhaps our eQTL data is not capturing disease mechanisms as well as we would hope.</p>

<p>However, there are some important drawbacks to all the previous approaches I‚Äôve described so far. In particular, these approaches cannot distinguish ‚Äúmediation‚Äù (our desired scenario) from other causality scenarios. Two of these scenarios include ‚Äúpleiotropy‚Äù (in which the same SNP affects gene expression and disease independently of each other) and ‚Äúlinkage‚Äù (in which two SNPs separately affect gene expression and disease but are in LD with each other). The colocalization-based methods try to rule out linkage as an explanation for overlap between eQTLs and GWAS hits, but <em>none</em> of the methods can (nor do they attempt to) distinguish pleiotropy from mediation.</p>

<p>This brings us to our paper. In my opinion, the most direct way to understand how ‚Äúimportant‚Äù eQTLs are to disease is via some sort of quantification of mediation, since mediation is how we tend to conceptualize the involvement of gene expression in disease. How do we measure mediation? We do this by quantifying the <em>proportion of disease heritability</em> that is mediated by gene expression levels. This definition might be a little opaque, so I‚Äôll try to break it down.</p>

<h1 id="defining-disease-heritability-mediated-by-gene-expression-levels">Defining ‚Äúdisease heritability mediated by gene expression levels‚Äù</h1>

<p>Heritability is a natural way to think about the total effect of genetics on a trait. We can imagine that each SNP exerts some causal effect on the disease, which we‚Äôll call \( \omega_k \) for SNP \( k \) (usually people use \( \beta \) to refer to this quantity, but I ended up using \( \beta \) for eQTL effect sizes in the paper instead - too late to change now.)</p>

<p>[image]</p>

<p>Now, we can think about a model in which each SNP‚Äôs effect on disease is <em>mediated</em> through the expression of one or more genes.</p>

<p>[image]</p>

<p>Note that each SNP effect size has a mediated component and a non-mediated component. The mediated component can be broken down into the product of eQTL effect sizes and gene effect sizes on trait.</p>

<p>[image]</p>

<p>In this model, we can feel free to interpret these effect sizes in the most intuitive way possible: \(\beta_{ik}\) represents the change in expression of gene \(i\) in individuals carrying an allele of SNP \(k\), \(\alpha_i\) is the change in trait per unit change in expression of gene \(i\), and \(\gamma_k\) is the extra change in the trait in individuals carrying an allele of SNP \(k\) that doesn‚Äôt go through expression. Because we don‚Äôt want to weigh highly expressed or variable genes more than others, we‚Äôll scale gene expression to have the same mean and variance across all genes. Thus, you can think of eQTL effect sizes in terms of expression change proportional to overall expression and variance of the gene.</p>

<p>How do we quantify overall mediation? Well, one way to do it would be to just take all the mediated parts of each effect size and sum them up. Because effect sizes can be positive or negative, we‚Äôll square everything. We end up with a quantity that I‚Äôll call \(h_{med}^2\):</p>

<p>\[h_{med}^2 = \sum_{i} \alpha_i^2 \sum_{k} \beta_{ik}^2 \]</p>

<p>Finally, we can divide this quantity by the total SNP effect on disease \( \sum_k \omega_k^2 \) to get the <em>proportion</em> of total SNP effect on disease mediated by gene expression.</p>

<p>\[\frac{h_{med}^2}{h_g^2} = \frac{\sum_{i} \alpha_i^2 \sum_{k} \beta_{ik}^2}{\sum_k \omega_k^2} \]</p>

<p>Feel free to skip the following technical points if you want.</p>

<p><strong>Technical point 1</strong>: In practice, we don‚Äôt quite estimate \(h_{med}^2\) as defined above. We like to operate in units of <em>heritability</em> (which are comparable across different traits in different populations). When operating in units of heritability, each SNP effect size is scaled by the variance of the SNP‚Äôs minor allele count, which in turn depends on the SNP‚Äôs minor allele frequency (MAF) in the population. In other words, SNPs contribute to heritability proportional to both their per-allele effect size (what we intuitively think of as their effect size in an individual) as well as their MAF, which causes common variants to contribute more to heritability than rare variants. Working with scaled effect sizes enables us to write \(h_g^2 = \sum_k \omega_k^2 \), without having to think about the variance of individual SNP counts. Scaling effect sizes by MAF may lead us to change our interpretation of these effect sizes, but I‚Äôll posit that we don‚Äôt have to change our interpretation <em>that</em> much (since we are only looking at common variants anyway, for which there isn‚Äôt a strong relationship between per-allele effect size and MAF). If this point is confusing, it may be helpful to read my other blog post on heritability.</p>

<p><strong>Technical point 2</strong>: Whenever I talk about ‚Äúheritability,‚Äù I will be referring specifically to SNP heritability \(h_g^2\). When thinking in terms of SNP heritability, it‚Äôs not quite appropriate to think of \(\omega_k\) or \(\beta_{ik}\) as representing the <em>causal</em> effect size of SNP \(k\). It will actually represent this causal effect size <em>in addition to</em> tagging effects of any SNPs in LD with SNP \(k\) that are not included in the set of common GWAS SNPs being studied.</p>

<p>Ok, so we have our quantity that we want to estimate: \(h_{med}^2\). Now for the hard part: actually estimating it. In the process of estimating this quantity, we will have to distinguish mediation from the other undesirable scenarios such as pleiotropy and linkage. Let‚Äôs go into how we do this.</p>

<h1 id="distinguishing-pleiotropy-from-mediation">Distinguishing pleiotropy from mediation</h1>

<p>People have already thought about ways to approach this problem, in particular under the umbrella of <em>Mendelian randomization</em> (MR) methods. There are many different types of MR, which all come with their own bag of assumptions and pros/cons. I will specifically talk about types of MR that use <em>multiple genetic variants</em> (some examples included inverse-variance weighted MR or Egger regression).</p>

<p>MR with multiple genetic variants relies on the idea that if the effect of . This idea is somewhat philosophical and tied to our belief of how mediation should work.</p>

<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>eQTL</strong>: An eQTL is a GWAS hit in which we have our trait of interest be the expression levels of some gene.</li>
  <li><strong>Linkage disequilibrium</strong>: You can think of LD as correlations between nearby SNPs across individuals in a population.</li>
  <li><strong>Heritability</strong>: If you‚Äôre not comfortable with thinking about heritability, please see my other blog post(s) on it. Briefly, you can think of heritability as the ‚Äútotal effect of genetics on a phenotype.‚Äù This quantity is often more straightforward to estimate than individual SNP effects on a phenotype, which are complicated by LD.</li>
  <li><strong>Heritability enrichment</strong>: is related to the idea of ‚Äúpartitioning heritability,‚Äù in which we quantify how much total effect is coming from a <em>particular set of SNPs</em> (rather than the set of all SNPs). We are free to define this set of SNPs in any way that we want; for example, these SNPs can be located on a given chromosome, or be located in genomic regions annotated as carrying a particular histone mark, etc. The ‚Äúheritability enrichment‚Äù of this set of SNPs is simply how much more heritability is coming from those SNPs than expected (a.k.a. if genetic effect was uniformly distributed across all SNPs). Enrichment for heritability means that more genetic effect on disease is coming from these SNPs than average, so we can interpret these SNPs as being more disease-relevant than average.</li>
  <li><strong>Marginal vs causal</strong>: Sometimes I will refer to a GWAS or eQTL effect size as ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù or ‚Äúcausal.‚Äù A SNP‚Äôs ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù effect size is one that comes straight out of a GWAS. Due to correlations between SNPs, these effect sizes will ‚Äútag‚Äù the effects of nearby SNPs. A SNP‚Äôs ‚Äúcausal‚Äù effect size is its <em>actual</em> effect on the trait, which does not include these tagging effects. We typically cannot directly measure the causal effect size of a given SNP from GWAS, but there are some ways to get at SNPs with nonzero causal effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Fine-mapping</strong>: is a way to try to identify causal GWAS hits or eQTLs in a region of marginal GWAS hits or eQTLs. Without going into detail, fine-mapping methods take into account the LD structure of a region of associated SNPs and give you a probability that a particular SNP truly has a causal effect on the trait.</li>
  <li><strong>Colocalization</strong>: This concept is closely related to fine-mapping. One early way that people have tried to integrate eQTLs with GWAS was to simply intersect marginal GWAS hits with marginal eQTLs, but as you can imagine this is complicated by tagging effects of nearby SNPs. Colocalization involves jointly fine-mapping both the eQTL and GWAS hit in order to produce a probability that the exact same SNP is causal for both expression and trait.</li>
  <li><strong>Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS)</strong>: TWAS was developed as an alternative approach to colocalization. Rather than looking for genes with one or more eQTLs that have a high probability of also being GWAS hits (as colocalization does), TWAS looks for genes with <em>significant genetic correlation</em> between their expression and trait. You can think of genetic correlation between two traits as the <em>correlation</em> between the SNP effect sizes for those traits. In other words, in TWAS, we want to see that when eQTL effect sizes for a given gene go up, then the GWAS effect sizes of those SNPs also go up.</li>
  <li><strong>Colocalization vs TWAS</strong>: TWAS has various pros and cons relative to colocalization. For example, colocalization can eliminate scenarios where eQTLs and GWAS hits overlap due to ‚Äúlinkage,‚Äù whereas TWAS cannot (in fact, colocalization was specifically designed for this task). On the other hand, TWAS is more powerful than colocalization when a gene has multiple eQTLs that all overlap with GWAS hits.</li>
