I"ú<p>â€œHeritabilityâ€ is a quantity that is central to human genetics, and there is a huge amount of literature aiming to estimate various forms of it. Despite its ubiquity, there also seems to be a dearth of resources that explain what it actually is, in a way that is understandable to non-experts. Iâ€™m hoping that this blog post can address this. Iâ€™ll assume that the reader has at least a basic understanding of statistics and genetics (for example, you should know what a SNP, or genetic variant, is).</p>

<p>Heritability is the â€œproportion of varianceâ€ in a population of people that can â€œbe explainedâ€ by genetic variants. What do these words actually mean?</p>

<p>The notion of â€œproportion of variance explainedâ€ is an important concept in statistics. We must first start with some variable, which weâ€™ll call <em>y</em>. This variable will represent some real-life quantity such as an individualâ€™s height. Next, we must define some model that attempts to â€œexplainâ€ <em>y</em> in some way. In our case, letâ€™s say that we have two other variables <sub>subscript</sub></p>
