# About me

<img src="/assets/about_headshot.png" width="200" align="right" style="margin: -50px 0px 20px 40px">

Hello! I am a 3rd year PhD student in computational biology at Harvard University. I am co-advised by Sasha Gusev ([lab website](http://gusevlab.org/)) and Brian Cleary ([lab website](https://clearylab.broadinstitute.org/)). I received my B.S. in molecular biology from UCLA in 2018.

Read about my research [here](/research/). I also write blog posts [here](/blog/) and take notes on papers [here](/notes/).
