# About me

Hi! I received my Ph.D. in computational biology from Harvard in 2023 and B.S. in molecular biology from UCLA in 2018.

I'm currently self-funding the development of a new drug. Read more about this project and my past work [here](/projects/). 

I'm always down to chat about anything! Send me an email at douglasyao2 [at] gmail.com.
