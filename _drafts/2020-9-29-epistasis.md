title: Reconciling epistasis in individuals vs. populations
---

Epistasis is a general phrase used to refer to "interactions" between two or more genes on a phenotype. Different subfields of biology define "interaction" in different ways, leading to much confusion. In particular, in statistical genetics, it is customary to refer to epistasis as any sort of deviation from **linearity** of SNP effects on a phenotype. In other fields such as experimental biology, the definition of epistasis is much less clear, though it can be broadly defined as some sort of deviation from the **expected combined effects** of single genes on a phenotype (where the way we specify how to combine effects often differs from study to study).  

One perhaps surprising fact about human populations is that _heritability_ explained by epistatic effects tends to be very low for virtually every trait we've looked at (implying mostly linear effects of SNPs on a trait in a population), and attempts to identify individual SNP pairs with significant epistatic effects in human populations has proven basically fruitless. On the other hand, there are endless molecular biology experiments that indicate a high degree of dependence between genes in a biological pathway; it seems absurd to imagine that each gene exerts independent additive effects on some downstream phenotype. Is there a contradiction going on here? In this blog post, I will try to make the claim that there is in fact _not_ a contradiction due to the fact that epistasis in an individual ("physiological epistasis") is a very different thing from epistasis in a population ("statistical epistasis"). In the process, I will go through all definitions of epistasis.

For further reading, you can check out this nice review paper by , from which I borrowed some terminology.

# Competing definitions of epistasis

In this section I'll go through the definitions

## "Physiological" epistasis







# Some motivating examples

To illustrate the apparent disparities between results on epistasis across different contexts, I'd like to discuss two papers that aim to











# Physiological epistasis

Molecular biology studies have shown us that , mutations in one gene will only have an effect on some downstream phenotype (e.g. some cell function) in the presence or absence of mutations in another gene. There is also a

In discussing physiological epistasis, I'd like to discuss a series of studies that perhaps come the closest to
