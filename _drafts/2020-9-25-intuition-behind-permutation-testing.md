title: Intuition behind permutation testing
---

Permutation testing is a very widely used tool to perform hypothesis testing. There already exist many resources out there that explain the procedure behind permutation testing. I've also performed permutation testing myself in my own research. However, for a long time I felt like I never really _understood_ permutation tests. _WHY_ is it valid to just permute your sample/label pairs to construct an empirical null distribution? When is this procedure _not_ valid? How does permutation testing compare with parametric hypothesis testing, and in what scenarios would we want to use either? How does permutation testing compare with other resampling methods such as a bootstrapping? This blog post represents my attempt to answer these questions in a way that is both non-technical and as detailed as possible.

# A brief overview of permutation testing

As there already exist a lot of resources out there


# Why is it valid to permute sample/label pairs to construct an empirical null distribution?

Let me 


The answer to this question actually is relevant to (frequentist) hypothesis testing as a whole

# When is this procedure not valid?
