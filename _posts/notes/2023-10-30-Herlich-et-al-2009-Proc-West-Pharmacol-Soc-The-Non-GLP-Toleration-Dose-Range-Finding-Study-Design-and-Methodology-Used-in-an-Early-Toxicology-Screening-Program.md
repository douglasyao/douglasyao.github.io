# Summary

Things one aims to learn from a toleration (dose range finding) study

* Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
* Early dose and time-related toxicological effects
* Dose selection for GLP tox studies

Study design

* Usually conducted in both rats and dogs (sometimes primates)
* Single dose escalation (SDE)
    * Rats and dogs receive single doses of drug over a large dose range (25-2000 mg/kg for rats, 50 and 250 mg/kg for dogs)

* Repeat dose (RD) phase
    * Drug is repeatedly dosed (how often?) at 3 dose levels (informed by results from SDE phase) over a 14 day period

Things that get measured

* Clinical observations
    * Body weight is measured pre-dose, once weekly, after the last dose, and prior to necropsy

        * Righting reflex: ability to go back to normal when flipped over or put on the side
        * Prostration: animal is stretched out on the ground, indicating severe weakness or illness
        * Catatonia: maintaining postures for abnormal amounts of time, immobility
        * Ataxia: wobbly or unstable walking, jerky movements
        * Tonic convulsions: sustained muscle contraction leading to stiffness or rigidity
        * Clonic convulsions: rhythmic muscle contractions leading to jerking 
        * Erythema: red or pink patches on skin 
        * Edema: swelling caused by accumulation of fluid 
        * Alopecia: hair loss/thinning
        * Piloerection: goosebumps, hair standing up
        * Miosis: narrowing of pupils
        * Mydriasis: enlargement of pupils
        * Exophthlamia: abnormal bulging of eyeball
        * Conjunctiva: tissue covering the front of the eye (possible inflammation)
        * Palpebral fissure: eye opening (size and appearance)
        * Dyspnea: difficulty breathing
        * Apnea: temporary pause in breathing
        * Tachypnea: rapid breathing
        * Buccal stain: stain on cheek area
    
    * Clinical observations are collected at the following time points
        * SDE: predose, several times post dose 
        * RD: predose, and at the anticipated maximal serum concentration

* Clinical pathology
    * SDE: blood collected 24 hrs post-dose
    * RD: blood collected after last of repeat doses

        * ALT: enzyme present in hepatocytes that leaks into the blood following cell damage
        * AST: enzyme in liver parenchymal cells whose elevation in serum levels suggests liver damage. Also found in red blood cells and skeletal muscle. 
        * Elevated ALT and AST tend to be non-specific but can provide some evidence for liver cell injury
        * Total bilirubin
            * increases can indicate intervascular hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells)
            * decreases can indicate deficiency in hepatic metabolism or obstruction of the bile ducts
        
        * ALP: enzyme found in cells lining biliary ducts of the liver (also kidney, bone, and placental tissue)
            * Increases can indicate liver damage or bile duct obstruction
        
        * GGT: enzyme that transports amino acids across hepatic, renal, and biliary cells
            * Increase is closely associated with biliary damage

* Pathology/histopathology
    * Pathology is conducted to determine the cause of death for animals that die or are euthanized earlier than planned
    * Also conducted in regularly euthanized animals

    * Microscopic examination occurs after tissues are fixed and stained with H&E

* Toxicokinetics 
    * SDE in rodents: TK measured post-dose at various time points (around projected time for maximal plasma concentration up to 24 hrs after dosing)
    * SDE in dogs and RD in dogs/rodents: TK measured at multiple time points (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 7, 24 hours). From this, cmax (maximum serum concentration), tmax (time to maximum serum concentration), and AUC are computed

* Toxicogenomics
    * Gene expression analysis sometimes conducted in rats
        * Samples collected at single dose but at 3 dose levels from RD phase from blood and liver tissue
    
    * Expression of cytochrome P450 and various other markers of liver function are measured
    * GE analysis sometimes also in human hepatocyte (liver cell) cell lines
