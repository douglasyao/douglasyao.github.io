# Summary

* Safety pharmacology became a thing after the emergence of rare cardiac adverse effects from terfenadine (an antihistamine used to treat hay fever) in the 1990s
* IND applications either get approved or put "on hold" (with a request for more data); seems like there is no "reject" option
* Extent of safety pharmacology studies depends on disease: more severe diseases (or those w/o existing treatments) can get away with less safety studies
    * Example: life-threatening disease w/o existing treatments requires only a single study (n=4 dogs) with integrated telemetry recording (i.e. continuous monitoring with various sensors) of cardiovascular parameters, CNS neurological examination, and respiratory profile using a pneumotachometer (device used to measure flow of air into and out of lungs)
    * Non-life-threatening disease may require full functional observation battery (FOB), including 30 parameters

* Safety pharmacology depends on drug
    * Biologics don't need to be investigated for hERG binding (leading to torsades de pointes)
    * First-in-class small molecules needs to be tested for everything

* Depends on subjective risk/benefit profile of drug
* Timing of core battery studies and which non-core-battery studies to do depend on judgement of drug sponsor
* Sometimes drug discovery teams will run non-GLP safety studies prior to core battery based on results from discovery teams (depending on drug)
    * For example: CV adverse effects are higher for multi-target tyrosine tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Repeat-dose safety pharmacology studies in conscious animals measuring systemic arterial pressure and chronotropic (changing heart rate) effects are justified here

* If drug is bioavailable and has adequate PK in different species, it will be tested in a range of species (is this required?) 
* Biologics usually don't require extra safety studies
    * First step: dose range finding (or tolerance studies)
    * DRF studies include cage side observations (for physical and behavioural effects), drug exposure analysis, blood chemistry, haematology, pathology and histopathology

* Typical "core battery" safety pharmacology studies
    * Usually GLP compliant (but not necessarily?)
    * Usually conducted with a single drug dose (in same administration route of tox and matching clinical route)
    * Cardiovascular (CV) safety is usually assessed in a conscious telemetry study in large animals from tox studies (n=4) using Latin square or dose-escalation design with sufficient drug wash-out times between dosing 
        * Why are there multiple doses here?
    
    * Respiratory safety assessed in conscious rats (n=8) and sometimes dogs/monkeys when rats aren't suitable
    * CNS safety evaluated using modified Irwin test in rats (n=10) or other animals when appropriate 
    * Sometimes EEG monitoring, respiration, animal activity by jacketed external telemetry is done
